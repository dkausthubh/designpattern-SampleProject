# Employee ASSET Management System (designpattern-SampleProject)

This is a sample Design Pattern Learning Project with implementation of Creational design pattern.
such as Singleton, Factory, Factory Method & Abstract Factory Method according to different requirement basis.

Employee MVC is a Employee ASP.net MVC Web Application Project & Logger is a Class Liabrary Project using Singleton Design Pattern for Exception Loggig.

> Singleton design pattern comes handy in the situations where we need to have a single instance of the object.
here in the application exceptions will be logged under the file created by the logger class library.

> Factory pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
here in the application its used to differ the salary component according to type of employees & Any new type creation is handled with a change of code in the factory class and not in the client code.

>Factory Method pattern, I have used here to implement requirement/data specific to Type of Employee.

>Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

Happy Learning!
